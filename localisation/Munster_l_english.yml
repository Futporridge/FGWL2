 POLITICS_CLEMENS_GALEN_DESC:0 "The future bishop was born on March 16, 1878 in the family of Count Ferdinand von Galen, who belongs to an ancient and pious aristocratic family, many of which were bishops of Cologne, Münster, as well as knights of the Teutonic Order. Clemens's father was a devout Catholic who raised his children based on the ideals of faith, order and diligence. Clemens was educated first at a Jesuit school and then at the University of Freiburg, also controlled by the Jesuits. In 1896 - 1899 he served in the imperial army at the final stage of the Second Revolutionary War, and even took part in hostilities. All this led to von Galen's ardent adherence to the Catholic values, not without, however, a tinge of arrogance and stubbornness. Since his election in 1933 to the post of Bishop of Münster, von Galen has eagerly resisted the movement for the secularization of the principality, sometimes resorting to typical Jesuit methods of fighting his opponents. For his bold statements and decisiveness in actions, he acquired the nickname "The Lion of Munster". However, these qualities often lead to misunderstandings between Galen and secular rulers, and even other representatives of the church leadership. And even more so, he became the main enemy in the eyes of the liberals and socialists, who will make every effort to discredit and deprive the main zealot in all of Westphalia."
 munster_imperfect_administrative_structure:0 "Imperfect Administrative Structure"
 munster_imperfect_administrative_structure_desc:0 "The Prince-Bishopric  of Münster is in fact united by 4 neighboring ecclesiastical estates, as well as 2 secular principalities, but each of them still has its own administration. This complicates the centralized rule of the state, namely tax collection, recruiting and political control. Complex structure also hinders economic development and fosters abuse, which causes public discontent" 
 munster_economic_difficulties:0 "Economic Difficulties"
 munster_economic_difficulties_desc:0 "The territory of the Principality of Münster is overshadowed by the economic strength of the neighboring Ruhr industrial region, which is  like a magnet for investment and skilled labor. In this regard, the development of our own industry and trade is slowed down, and the economy is highly dependent on neighboring states. In addition, the low prosperity of peasants and workers is another source of popular discontent and fertile ground for left-wing populism." 
 munster_secularization_movement:0 "Secularization Movement"
 munster_secularization_movement_desc:0 "Imperfect administration, economic problems, the reactionary policies of the current ruling bishop and the general rise in popularity of the left, republican and nationalist ideologies are the reasons for the existence in Münster of a powerful movement for the secularization of the principality, represented by various political forces. Not only it leads the revolutionary agitation, it is also engaged in sabotaging the work of authorities at all levels. Secularists seek to undermine the authority of the bishop in the eyes of secular rulers and the church leadership and spread dirty rumors about the corruption and cruelty towards the population prevailing in his lands. \n\n§RIt is possible that if the situation in the principality worsens, the revolutionaries will try to seize power by force.§R"  
 munster_iron_fisted_rule:0 "Iron Fisted Rule"
 munster_iron_fisted_rule_desc:0 "Possessing a heavy temper and a firm conviction in the need for the supremacy of spiritual reign over secular, the bishop is not ready to put up with the activity of secularists and revolutionaries in his diocese. In this regard, there is tough censorship on the territory of the principality, and activists of liberal and socialist organizations are persecuted and subjected to various punishments. In this, the bishop is assisted by the members of the Jesuit order, as well as the military monastic orders of the Templars and Teutons, who enjoy great influence in the principality, considering it their duty to instill fear in the enemies of the bishop. Someone thinks that such measures condone abuses and lead to further destabilization and rebellion, but the bishop is sure that only a strong hand can keep Munster from revolution."
