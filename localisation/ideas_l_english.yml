schwarze_armee:0 "Schwarzer Armee"
schwarze_armee_desc:0 "Black Army (Schwarzer Armee) is perhaps the most combat-ready force of the erupting South German uprising, led by the charismatic Horst Wessel. Includes in itself both a simple population, and numerous mercenaries, deserters and robbers"

baltic_beacon:0 "Beacon of the German Frontier"
baltic_beacon_desc:0 "From the very foundation of the German Order in 1190, until its arrival in Prussia in 1231 and to the current days, the Teutonic Order was at the forefront of German-Catholic interests. The people of the order are accustomed to the constant raids of pagans and heretics, and are not ready to give up under any circumstances, in the name of that holy mission that they carry to these wild places"
teutonic_disorder:0 "Crippled Administration"
teutonic_disorder_desc:0 "The Germans, as well as some other minorities that subordinate to the order, unconditionally prevail in cities, but if one would just go outside the city, it will immediately become clear that there are no Germans anywhere outside it, the roots of this problem grow from the ineffective administrative apparatus of the order that has concentrated its attention only in cities and now little can be done with this situation."
teutonic_failed_integration:0 "Disorder in the countryside"
teutonic_failed_integration_desc:0 "New waves of unrest are rolling in the countryside, the local population of Poles and Lithuanians are unhappy with the latest decisions of the order. More and more often, beaten officials return from their villages, and Orders escorts disappear in the forests. And even if the population does not have the possibility for an open uprising, the riots still cripple our administration."
teutonic_political_power_struggle:0 "Power Struggle"
teutonic_political_power_struggle_desc:0 "Since the beginning of modern times, the Teutonic Order has been confronted by their ancient state system, where all power belongs to knight brothers and priests, on the one hand, the ancient traditions of the military-monastic corporation are strongly represented in the Teutonic Order, on the other, many believe that the order exists on the basis of such a structure for hundreds of years, already in itself is a miracle. In this situation, the future order is given not only to the Master, but also to the people themselves, who have already begun to gather in groups and parties, and actively fight for the domination of their ideas."
Archaic_Military_System:0 "Archaic Military System"
Archaic_Military_System_desc:0 "Although the military system of the order has been reformed, it is still very archaic and decentralized, large cities and districts themselves are responsible for their protection and supply, centrally it is all managed only in wartime. With such odd system, it is absolutely impossible to produce any heavy weaponry, due to the fact that even a rich and large city alone does not have the industrial capacity to produce and maintain complex and expensive weapons, in addition to all of that, orders system favors corruption, and even is responsible for the shortages of recruits and underproduction of equipment in many regions."
Knightly_Aristocracy_of_the_Order:0 "Knightly Aristocracy of the Order"
Knightly_Aristocracy_of_the_Order_desc:0 "Knightly Aristocracy of the Order - With the entry into ever more recent times, the Teutonic Order had to reform its military system and the presence of the knight brothers was reduced only to generality and governorship, thus turning the order into something like a military aristocratic republic. The presence of the chivalrous aristocracy gave rise to fractionalism, corruption, personal armies, as well as the extreme backwardness of both the army and the political sphere of the Order. With the coup d'etat of the Teutonic Knighthood and the overthrow of Eugen of Austria, the power in the country passed to the very order of the aristocracy, only exacerbating the problems of the crippled Europe, if one is going to do something with the current situation in the order, he will have to start with the ancient aristocracy of the order itself."
