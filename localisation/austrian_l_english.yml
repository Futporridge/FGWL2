super.8.a:0 "Vaterland, dir woll'n wir sterben!"
aus.1.t:0 "Preparations for the Reichstag"
aus.1.d:0 "An important day is approaching - the convocation of the Reichstag. In honor of this, the Austrian government made a simple but elegant decision: to decorate Regensburg in honor of the arrival of numerous representatives of various regions of the "Holy Empire". \n\nThis should cheer up not only the delegates who come to the city, but also its indigenous inhabitants, because the city itself has been hosting Reichstag meetings for a very long time. \n\nIn the mind of common people the image of this convocations is closely associated with Regensburg, and vice versa - everyone knows this city for the fact that almost all the convocations of parliament were held in it."
aus.1.a:0 "The scenery was prettier last time..."
aus.2.t:0 "First Day of the Reichstag"
aus.3.t:0 "The end of the Reichstag"
aus.3.d:0 "Session of the Reichstag had to be ended earlier than intended. It turned out... Rather tense. \n\nDuring the event participants separated into two opposed groups, The Southern and Northern states.  But the 2 Groups weren't willing to compromise, as the Southern Principalities, which weren't as economically developed as, the Northern princes, who supported Brandenburg and refused to aid the Austrian Crown at all. \n\nThe meeting nearly ended up as a scandal, but was disbanded by the Austrian Monarch Otto. So the representatives of the northern Empire soon returned to their homes refusing to elaborate any further. \n\nIt looks like the Austrian Crown will have to deal with their problems single handedly..."
aus.3.a:0 "Ungrateful fools!"

aus.4.t:0 "Report from the Economic Ministry"
aus.5.t:0 "Panic!"
aus.5.d:0 "Recent report of the Ministry of Finance caused certain concerns in the economic circles of the Empire. \n\nAnd after a while one small spark turned into a real wildfire - some of the owners of large capital began to frantically sell their economic possessions, just to preserve at least some share of their wealth, and undertaking all possible means to save it, including the sale of shares for almost free price. \n\nEvery day, the situation is heating up more and more, and if you do not take at least some measures, a slight insanity will turn into a nationwide panic."
aus.5.a:0 "So much trouble due to a couple of fools?"
aus.6.t:0 "Small Venice of the New World"
aus.6.d:0 "Welserland is, to say one of the best colonies not only in the colonial empire of Austrian Crown, but one of the best colonies in the world. \n\nFlow of migrants from the entirety of HRE and the free market, this is the secret of this province's success. \n\nThe Industrial Revolution made these lands a paradise, and the starting Oil Fever beckons subjects from all over the empire. \n\nThe only problem with this land, our administration does not get those preferences that we could. But anyway, the Welserland is a living example of the working German colonial model."
aus.6.a:0 "Sometimes there are miracles on our earth!"
aus.9.t:0 "Johann Puch & Comp. Closed!"
aus.9.d:0 "One of the most known Austrian Crown automobile manufacturers has announced it's bankruptcy. Johann Puch & Comp. became the first victim of economical disaster. \n\nRecently stocks of the company started to rapidly lose value, wherefore the investors started to withdraw their finances, thus bankrupting the company. \n\nPuch & Comp. became known throughout the Europe due to their creater, engineer Johann Puch, who developed 21 different types of cars, as well as lorries, buses, military and some other special vehicles, including sedan limousines for the royal Habsburg family. \n\nIt may be not the most important company of country, yet it's closing can seriously damage the status of Imperial Crown, as well as spread the panic wider."
aus.9.a:0 "But we still have the Gräf & Stift, right?"
aus.9.b:0 "Give them subsidies, they will remember it!"
aus.22.t:0 "Departure of the Emperor"
aus.22.d:0 "Despite the Crown's measures to deal with the impending crisis, it could not be stopped - it came, and it came with terrible force. \n\nLevel of the unemployment was growing fast, and more and more people, dissatisfied with such situation joined into various radical groups. Which grew more and more numerous by the day, and each of them had their own demands. \n\nIt's looks like the contradictions will tear this country apart. This is why regent advised Otto to escape the Austria and hide in his relative's residence in Latin Empire, while Viktor Dankl will try to stabilize the situation. \n\nThe emperor, who did not wish to repeat the grim fate of the French queen, agreed, albeit grudgingly..."
aus.22.a:0 "Alea iacta est"
aus.25.t:0 "Unexpected Discovery"
aus.25.d:0 "In the course of a recent investigation by the regent’s secret police, one very unpleasant detail was revealed - as it turned out, a secret organization called the "Soldatenring"(or the Soldier Ring) \n\nled by General Maximilian De Angelis had been operating in the country for a long time. The conspirators managed to remain in the shadows, yet recently government were lucky to arrest one of its members for activities not related to the "Soldatenring". \n\nDuring the search of his apartment, several incriminating documents were found, which led to the transfer of this case to the hands of higher authorities. The motives of this organization are not yet known, but the government understands that they should not be ignored ..."
aus.25.a:0 "Disarm soldiers, now!"
aus.29.t:0 "Coup d'etat"
aus.29.d:0 "Concerns about the activity of the Soldatenring were not in vain, due to the latest actions of the regent Viktor Dankl von Krasnik the situation came out of control - the regent began to pursue a policy of demilitarization. Which prompted the organization to attempt a coup d'état. \n\nWithout receiving any resistance, since the capital's garrison mostly sided with the conspirators, commander Maximilian de Angelis and his guard surrounded the government building. An ultimatum was put forward - either the government transfers power peacefully, or the Soldatenring will take it by force. \n\nThe supporters of the regency did not stand a chance, and they had accepted the ultimatum, soon after, soldiers entered the building and took government officials under arrest."
aus.29.a:0 "So easy? I can't even believe it."
aus.30.t:0 "Banatian Incident"
aus.30.d:0 "The very recent events in Serbia are adding more scraps of information, to perhaps, even worse situations than we thought. However, every cloud has a silver lining, one of the few positive news in Austria. \n\nSerbian terrorists attempted to seize Banatian territory. According to eyewitness accounts, Serbs robbed several garrisons in Vojvodina and set off for Temesburg. But the German militia, assembled on local initiative, was able not only to fight back, but also to counterattack the Slavic advance for a time. Through the efforts of the citizens of Austria, we were able to preserve the region, and the newly formed Banat government has already issued a report on the incident to the Administrative Apparatus. \n\nMaximilian de Angelis has already announced a reward to Hermann Reschny - Ehren-Denkmünze für Tapferkeit, and many prominent patriots and daring adventurers have decided to get to the frontier. For men and women of Deutschland, Banat became an example of the indomitable nature of the Germanic people."
aus.30.a:0 "Dus drinken we samen!"
aus.31.t:0 "Angelis Proclaims the Republic"
aus.31.d:0 "The first decree of new Vienna government became the  "Proclamation of the Abolition of the Monarchy".  A fateful choice for the entire empire happened that night.\n\n After a three three-hour long argument schemers created a manifesto of a new Austrian government, main goal of which is abolishment of the Habsburg Monarchy and proclomation of the new German republic. \n\nThe ceremony of proclamation of the Republic will take place in the next few days. Yet the rumors has it that the officers of Angelis is about to hold Austria's first-ever free election, but they are not supported by what is left of the government. "
aus.31.a:0 "Rejoice, Citizen!"
aus.32.t:0 ""Heil Vater der Nation""
aus.32.d:0 "Vienna's intellectual community has begun to bless the revolutionary dictator. The recent seizure of power by Maximilian de Angelis and the proclamation of the first republic has stirred the minds of progressive intelligentsia. \n\nAt dinner parties and philosophical clubs, there is only talks of the revolution by a group of officers, as well as several known authors have already announced a desire to write a novel, based on the story of Maximilian de Angelis. It is said that Sigmund Freud himself visited the Reichstag recently, but this is only a rumor that has no proof. \n\nMany of the cultural elite of the capital have already vowed to serve the ideals of the German nation and democracy that the general would give them. More and more often, the proud cry of "Heil Vater der Nation" is heard in public places in Vienna."
aus.32.a:0 "Did he say anything about democracy at all?"
aus.33.t:0 "Smoking on Vienna Streets"
aus.33.d:0 "A good portion of citizens of Vienna may have decided that the good fellow generals are merciless murderers, who only think of warmongering and extortion of the common people. \n\nOn the contrary, General Angelis has announced the removal of a number of restrictions, especially for the population of republican capital. Smoking is now allowed on the streets of Vienna! Unseen luxury, both for the intelligentsia and fancy gentlemen but to the common proletariat as well now is not punished with no fines or criminal charges. \n\nOver the top conservative and snooty Aristocrats will of course be mad, from the mere sight of a citizen smoking a cigarette. Yet, this is only good, because it will help us locate counterrevolutionary elements before they do any bad thing. \n\nIn the end, the young state should change to keep up with the times. Long live the Republic!"
aus.33.a:0 "Ah, that wonderful smell of freedom"
aus.35.t:0 "Crimes and Punishments"
aus.35.d:0 "The power has been seized, the loyalty of many military men achieved. Yet, Maximilian de Angelis doesn't like the fact that the socialists and other enemies of the new state have organized into organizations that threaten the new rule. \n\nThe general made a brutal but necessary decision to save the country - the opposition had to be suppressed before it could gain enough power! Specially selected squads of stormtroopers started to methodically disarm and incarcerate various opponents of the regime. \n\nSo far, however, our stormtroopers have only been effective in crushing various groups of monarchists, leaving socialists mostly unharmed. But in spite of these first steps, the state will mend its ways further cementing Maximilian's will."
aus.35.a:0 "We all have to make sacrifices!"
aus.37.t:0 "Disrupted Elections"
aus.37.d:0 "Recent events have greatly influenced the political situation in the country. After General Maximilian de Angelis took power by force and overthrew the monarchy, to the delight of many people, proclaiming a republic in the process. \n\nIn order to bring legitimacy to his regime, Maximilian de Angelis publicly announced that the new government will be holding elections. However, everything didn't go as smoothly as the Maximilian planned - the elections were only held in Austria, Galicia, Czechia and Slovenia. On the territories of Hungarian Crown, the turnout was minimal - its entire population boycotted the new government, remaining faithful to the monarchist principles. \n\nAnd the situation in the South went completely beyond the norm - the southern Balkans remained under the administrative control of the Austrians only on paper. Real power over the region currently belongs to the Chetniks, and they refuse to enter into any negotiation with the current government."
aus.37.a:0 "Damned be those small nations..." 
aus.39.t:0 "Results of the Elections "
aus.39.d:0 "Counting of the votes is coming to an end, Austria made it's choice. Maybe it wasn't as fair and legitimate, yet everyone can learn from ones mistakes. Near the government building the lists of victorious parties and leaders who were elected into Parliament was published. To the thundering voice of crowd, the victor turned out to be...\n\nThe left block! United coalition of socialists has managed to surpass the Soldatenring, thus gaining majority in the Reichsrat. Maximilian de Angelis's attempt to annul the results was momentally presecuted by the nation-wide strikes and protests, not only by citizens, but also by some of the soldier units. \n\nLeft wing is already elected to the parlament thus it managed to gain access to government buildings and started to sabotage the actions of the General Maximilian, now as the bureaucratic force. \n\nEven though not every vote has been counted, yet it is clear that the rouge general has lost his victory"
aus.39.a:0 "The Socialists are in charge! Social State!" 
aus.39.b:0 "The Prometheists are in charge! Labor State!" 
aus.39.c:0 "The Liberals are in charge! Free State!" 
aus.40.t:0 "The Outcome"
aus.40.d:0 "Despite all the attempts of Maximilian de Angelis, the elections ended in an unexpected outcome: the bulk of the votes went to the left-wing parties. \n\nThe winners took most of the seats in parliament, and Angelis was left with only one option: to offer his patronage over the new government. However, it refused, and rouge warlord had again led his troops to take the capital. But this time, Angelis's guard drowned in numerous skirmishes with the left-wing militias that filled Vienna. \n\nThe General, along with a handful of his henchmen, was abled to escape, but, apparently, this is the end for the Soldatenring. Left paramilitary have already begun to seizing officers and soldiers suspected of treason. The Damocles Sword over the Austria was finally broken..."
aus.40.a:0 "The people's axe is generously sharpened!"
aus.41.t:0 "Grand Coalition"
aus.41.d:0 "Attempt of an Maximilian de Angelis to overthrow the legitimately elected government had failed.The general fled the capital in disgrace, leaving some of his stormtroopers to their fate. \n\nVienna is still not calm, yet the initial fire of the rebellion has faded... at least for some time. Left wing is well aware that their revolution has a lot of enemies, and they should temporarily forget their disagreements. \n\nAnd after a short congress it was decided to create a "Grand Coalition" - a union of all left-wing parties. It will be formed for the sake of preserving the achievements they have made, and will be in power until the situation in the country will stabilize."
aus.41.a:0 "Like Prometheus, we bring people freedom!"
aus.47.t:0 "Budapest isn't obeying Vienna!"
aus.47.d:0 "In connection with the latest events in the capital of the empire, the territories controlled by the Crown of the Saint Stephen ceased to obey the orders of Austria and severed any relations with the new government in Vienna. \n\nMany believe that this is just another trick of the Hungarian elite to gain more rights and autonomy. However, the authorities of Budapest deny this information, and explain their policy by the fact that they do not trust the authorities of the military junta, which overthrew the power of the legitimate monarch, succeeded by the dangerous radicals who are threatening to destroy everything that the Empire achieved. \n\nHungary considers such radical political changes dangerous for the Empire, especially its southern territories, where there are already a lot of problems. But the fact remains that the Magyar government is starting to play it's own political game."
aus.47.a:0 "Eh, we don't listen to reactionary lapdogs!"
aus.47.b:0 "God save, God protect Our Country!"
