The conspirators managed to remain in the shadows, yet recently government were lucky to arrest one of its members for activities not related to the "Soldatenring". \n\nDuring the search of his apartment, several incriminating documents were found, which led to the transfer of this case to the hands of higher authorities. The motives of this organization are not yet known, but the government understands that they should not be ignored ..."

aus.29.d:0 "Concerns about the activity of the Soldatenring were not in vain, due to the latest actions of the regent Viktor Dankl von Krasnik the situation came out of control - the regent began to pursue a policy of demilitarization. Which prompted the organization to attempt a coup d'état. \n\nWithout receiving any resistance, since the capital's garrison mostly sided with the conspirators, commander Maximilian de Angelis and his guard surrounded the government building. An ultimatum was put forward - either the government transfers power peacefully, or the Soldatenring will take it by force. \n\nThe supporters of the regency did not stand a chance, and they had accepted the ultimatum, soon after, soldiers entered the building and took government officials under arrest."
