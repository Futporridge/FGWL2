 ans.1.t:0 "Departure of the Margrave"
 ans.1.d:0 "Reichstag requires the presence in Vienna of all the princes or their representatives to discuss the financial difficulties that the Empire is currently experiencing. It is likely that a draft of new taxes will be put forward at the congress, but it is doubtful that it will be adopted. Nevertheless, most princes consider it necessary to be present at the same time, because dissatisfaction with the emperor Otto is ever higher, and the congress may have epoch-making significance for the Empire. Along with Elector Wilhelm, who no longer hides his plans for supremacy in northern Germany, his son, the acting Margrave Eitel, will arrive in Vienna. However, for him it is more like a social event with the opportunity to participate in the fun of the capital's yard. Meanwhile, local authorities have noted the increasing attacks on government officials in rural areas. Before leaving, in Nuremberg, there were demonstrations of the unemployed and workers of private factories, solidarity with which the workers of corporations expressed. They were dispersed by the burgomaster police, but the tension continues to increase."
