POLITICS_KURT_TIPPEL_DESC:0 "Kurt comes from an old Bavarian aristocratic family of von Tippelskirch. He was born the eldest son in the family of the Teutonic Major General Hans von Tippelskirch and his wife Helen, nee Stukenschmidt. After graduating from the cadet school in Gross-Lichterfeld, Tippelskirch joined the Teutonic army on June 24, 1909 as an ensign. On March 3, 1910 he graduated from the Danzig Military School. During this period, he began to write historical articles. During the revolutionary wars (1910-1920) Tippelskirch was sent as a lieutenant with his regiment to the western front, where he took part in the first battles. He was seriously injured in the battle of Verdun and was captured, from which he had already fled a year later. And he returned to the front as Hauptmann, with whom he ended the campaign in France, however, this was not the end of his military career. In 1920, due to the serious weakening of Austria and the discontent of the ancient Teutonic nobility, the Grand Master Eugen of Austria, were removed by the conspirators and a new, pro-Brandenburg master Paul von Hindenburg was installed. The Teutonic Order first enters into a coalition with the northern princes against Austria. During this period, Tippelskirch, for his merits and courage, was appointed the Commander, and invited to the General Staff of the order. Where a plan of war with Austria was already in full swing, which will soon be recreated in reality and will become the finest hour of the future hochmeister. The rebellion of the northern principalities and the order forces Austria to abolish the reforms of 1895 and becomes a serious blow to its prestige. After the war, Tippelskirch became one of the initiators of the small army reform, attracting the respect of many young military men and the grumbling of the old to his person. On July 8, 1927, after the death of Großkomtur Max Hoffman, Hochmeister Hindenburg, in an attempt to attract new blood and start a new package of small reforms, appoints the young and popular commander Kurt von Tippelskirch as the new great Großkomtur. During his commandery period, Kurt only strengthens his popularity in the ranks of the army and the intelligentsia, however, on August 2, 1934, the Hochmeister Hindenburg dies of cancer, after which a chapter is convened on which within three months the question of choosing a new great master is decided, the main candidates for the role of hochmeister turn out to be Tippelskirch himself and Orders Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt. After heated debates and angry speeches, on November 30, 1934, the Großkomtur Kurt von Tippelskirch was appointed the new Hochmeister of the Teutonic Order. Over the past two years, Kurt has been trying to contain that mess of a country he inherited, introducing more and more new laws and decisions that could prevent the inevitable crisis and the decline of the order. However, only time will tell whether Kurt will be a successful reformer and savior of the German frontier, or whether the wind of history will sweep away his country and achievements to the Tartarus."
